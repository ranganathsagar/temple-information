                <div class="title">THE HOLY CITY OF VARANASI</div>
                <p class="para">Varanasi, also known as Kashi or Banaras, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and is often regarded as the spiritual capital of India. Nestled on the banks of the sacred River Ganga in the northern Indian state
                    of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi holds immense significance for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and many other spiritual traditions. Its divine aura, rich history, and timeless traditions make it not just a city, but a living legend — a place
                    where life and death intersect in the most sacred ways. Historical Roots and Mythological Importance Varanasi’s origins are deeply rooted in mythology and history. According to Hindu beliefs, it was founded by Lord Shiva, the destroyer
                    in the holy trinity of Hindu gods. It is said that Varanasi rests on his trident and that it is one of the seven holy cities (Sapta Puri) which can grant moksha — liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Historians trace the city's
                    history back to more than 3,000 years, making it not only the spiritual heart of India but also a cradle of ancient civilization. Many classical texts, including the Rigveda, refer to the city. It has been a center of learning, philosophy,
                    and spirituality for thousands of years. The great Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang, who visited India in the 7th century CE, recorded the flourishing state of learning and religion in Varanasi.</p>

                <div class="title">THE GOLDEN CITY OF JAISALMER</div>
                <p class="para">Jaisalmer, famously known as The Golden City, is a mesmerizing destination located in the heart of the Thar Desert in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The city earns its golden nickname from the yellow sandstone used in its architecture,
                    which glows brilliantly under the desert sun. At the center of Jaisalmer stands the majestic Jaisalmer Fort, one of the largest fully preserved fortified cities in the world. Unlike typical forts, it is a living fort — home to shops,
                    temples, and families that have resided there for generations. Built in 1156 AD by Rawal Jaisal, it showcases the intricate craftsmanship of Rajput architecture. Jaisalmer is rich in culture, tradition, and folklore. The Havelis, or
                    traditional mansions like Patwon Ki Haveli and Salim Singh Ki Haveli, are architectural marvels with beautifully carved facades. The city also serves as a gateway to desert adventures, offering camel safaris, dune bashing, and enchanting
                    folk performances under starlit skies. With its golden hues, historical grandeur, and vibrant culture, Jaisalmer offers an unforgettable glimpse into Rajasthan’s royal heritage. It's not just a city, but a timeless tale carved in stone,
                    sand, and spirit.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <div class="title">THE GATEWAY OF INDIA : MUMBAI</div>
                <p class="para">The Gateway of India, standing proudly on the waterfront of Mumbai, is one of India’s most iconic monuments. Overlooking the Arabian Sea, this grand structure was built in 1924 to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to
                    India in 1911. Designed by architect George Wittet, the monument blends Indo-Saracenic, Mughal, and Gothic architectural styles, making it both historically and artistically significant. Constructed from yellow basalt and reinforced
                    concrete, the Gateway stands at a height of 26 meters. It served as the ceremonial entrance to India for British viceroys and officials, and later marked the symbolic departure point of British troops in 1948, signifying the end of
                    British rule. Today, the Gateway is a major tourist attraction and cultural hub, drawing millions of visitors every year. Located in the bustling Colaba district, it is surrounded by vibrant street markets, the majestic Taj Mahal Palace
                    Hotel, and ferry services to Elephanta Caves — a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As a symbol of Mumbai’s colonial past and its rise as a modern metropolis, the Gateway of India remains a powerful reminder of history, resilience, and architectural
                    splendor.
